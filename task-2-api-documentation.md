Task 2: API Documentation (Nudges)
Description

Designed and documented APIs for a Nudge creation feature based on the provided wireframe and functional requirements.

Key Points
-Schema-less data model
-Full CRUD API documentation
-Multipart payload support
-Extensible and future-ready API design

Note: Task 2 focuses on API design and documentation only. Backend implementation is intentionally out of scope.

Conclusion
This assessment demonstrates my ability to understand requirements, design scalable APIs, implement backend logic, and document APIs clearly following production-level practices.
